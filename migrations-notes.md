## Reset sequences on postgres

As the migration insert the same id that was on old database, postgres don't update the id sequence, so we need todo this manualy.

	rake db:reset_sequences

## Insert the new configurations for Neighbor.ly

	rake db:seed:neighborly


## To populate the routing number table


	rake update_routing_numbers

# After migration

In order to prevent some problems on migrations, I commented some codes and they need put back..

Find by `ADD BACK - REMOVED FOR MIGRATION` in the project and uncomment the code.
